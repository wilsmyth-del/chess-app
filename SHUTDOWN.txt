Shutdown checklist — Chess Tutor v1.1

Date: 2026-01-15

Steps to gracefully shut down and archive the app:

1) Stop the dev server (if running):
   - If using the provided venv on Windows PowerShell:
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     taskkill /IM python.exe /F
   - If running via `python server.py` in a console, press Ctrl+C in that console.

2) Ensure all PGNs and data are saved:
   - Check `games/` for recent `game_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pgn` files.
   - Optionally copy `games/` and `data/` to a backup location.

3) Archive repository and artifacts:
   - Create a zip/tar of the repo root excluding `venv/` and large engine binaries.

4) Optional: Remove transient state files
   - Delete `game_state.fen` in the repo root (Windows) or `/dev/shm/game_state.fen` on Linux if present.

5) Final git commit and push:
   - git add -A; git commit -m "chore: update CHANGELOG and add SHUTDOWN note"; git push

6) Reboot the host (optional) if you plan to free memory or ensure no engine processes remain.

Notes:
- If you want, I can run the final `git commit` for you and create a release tag.
- Tell me whether to push to origin or keep changes local.
